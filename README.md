It involves the management of a multitude of activities such as studying tour destinations, planning the tour, making travel arrangements, and providing accommodation. It also involves marketing efforts to attract tourists to travel to particular destinations.
The Internet has penetrated almost every corner of the world. Tourists are enjoying the benefits of the Internet. While planning a tour, the tourists try to get an idea about the 
places they are going to visit, the quality of amenities and services, and the attractions at the destination. After visiting a destination, the experienced tourists share their 
opinions on various platforms of the Internet. Performance: During the past several decades, the Travel and Tourism Management System is supposed to maintain manual handling of 
all the Travel Agency’s daily activities. The manual handling of the record is time-consuming and highly prone to error. To improve the performance of the Travel Agency, the

Conclusion

	The Tourism Management system is designed for users to choose destination, fights, and hotels, check ticket, generate tickets. Pseudo code is written for some important codes. 
A few flow charts are also created for explaining the process of the Tourism Management system.
	From this assignment, I have learnt to implement a few C concepts in the future projects such as functions, switch statement and do...while statement, arrays, pointers, else 
if statements and structures in the program. I have also learnt to create flow charts for explaining the program.
